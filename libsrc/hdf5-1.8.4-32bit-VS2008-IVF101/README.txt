This directory contains the binary (release) distribution of 
HDF5 1.8.4 that was compiled on an Intel PC running Windows XP,
using Visual Studio 2008/Intel Fortran 10.1.  It was built with
the following options: 
    -- C/C++/Fortran libraries, both static and shared
    -- SZIP (encoder enabled) and ZLIB
    -- Static and shared HDF5 tools

The contents of this directory are:

The binaries were built with ZLIB compression enabled (zlib 1.2.3). Therefore 
you MUST link with the GNU ZLIB library when compiling with these binaries. We 
provide the pre-compiled binary distribution for Windows for ZLIB 1.2.3 from 
our ftp server at:

    ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/zlib/1.2/bin/windows

These binaries were also built with SZIP 2.1 compression (encoder ENABLED).  
When compiling with these binaries, you must link with the SZIP library.  
Information regarding SZIP can be found at:

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/

You can obtain the SZIP source code and binaries from our ftp server at:
