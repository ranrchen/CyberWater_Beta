<i><h2>RoutingAgent</h2></i> Performs hydrologic routing using the Muskingum method following the run of the<br>
Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The routing is performed both for hill-slope <br>
elements corresponding to VIC cells, and for a network of channels. The network needs to be <br>
defined in a text file with the format described below. The produced flow values are in m3/s.<br>
<i><b>RoutingAgent</b></i> assumes a default initial state where none of the channels contain water.<br>
The user is free to go to the working directory and provide an initial state file with the format:<br>
'state_YYYYMMDD' Where YYYY, MM, and DD, are the year, month and day corresponding to the first day<br>
of the simulation. If the workflow is executed wich such existing file, it will be used as initial state.<br>
