ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ **Pooch v0.6.0 is the last release to support Python 2.7** ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

About
-----

*Does your Python package include sample datasets? Are you shipping them with the code?
Are they getting too big?*

Pooch will manage downloading your sample data files over HTTP from a server and storing
them in a local directory:

* Download a file only if it's not in the local storage.
* Check the SHA256 hash to make sure the file is not corrupted or needs updating.
* If the hash is different from the registry, Pooch will download a new version of the
  file.
* If the hash still doesn't match, Pooch will raise an exception warning of possible
  data corruption.

to see how you can help and give feedback.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equality important contributions include:
writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the
contribution process).
If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from
those mistakes.
That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
